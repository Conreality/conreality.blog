If you ever found yourself at a war-gaming event you might notice the
obvious *technological asymmetry* between players. Your usual Mil-Sim gang,
equipped with two-way radios and team tactics will usually dominate the rest
of the less coordinated bunch. The other downside being the pros can't
really coordinate with the rest of their own team if they don't __have
radios equipped themselves__. The resulting experience has a lovely name in
English - herding the cats.

*Game lobby screen. From here you can join the game via QR code, IP address,
or a game hosted on your local Wi-Fi network.*

That's where the Conreality Player comes in, we thought about this problem
and came up with a solution.

The application will serve as your gateway to team up, coordinate and most
importantly - effectively communicate with the other people in the __game__.
The gamers will recognize these features from their favorite FPS games.

*We're introducing the map and compass features in the first release.*

The goal of this test was to observe GPS team monitoring in real-time. We've
chosen an open-air field with possibility for a lot of movement and traveled
to southern Germany for a regular airsoft game hosted by the team [Drunken
Sheeps][1].

Again thanks to the [Drunken Sheeps][2] for hosting us, we'll definitely
