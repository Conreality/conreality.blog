The core feature of the Player application is to enable you to react faster to rapidly changing conditions on the war-gaming field. Military pros worth their analytical salt call this concept 'shortening of the OODA loop' (more on the concept [here][1]). After trying the application out for the first time in [Germany][2], we wanted to test a more direct form of communication. At the time the voice comms via Bluetooth weren't implemented yet, so we had to radically improvise.

 *More fun to yell these at people in a voice chat instead of typing down frantically on a smartphone keyboard.*

We gave a Bluetooth earbud connected to a spare phone with the application running to our friend playing in the arena. One team member was standing in the safe zone outside, and with a texting speed of a teenage girl going through social media drama typed down enemy positions to our friend playing inside.

Results were quite surprising - during one round our friend shot double the amount of enemies on the field based purely on increased situational awareness. This was achieved just with the Text-To-Speech commands coming live with a slight delay (just some growing pains, ouch) into the player's ear.

Our thanks goes to the [ProPaintball.sk](https://www.propaintball.sk/ "ProPaintball.sk website") team for allowing us to test the Conreality Player at their site. We'll be visiting the site again for another game in March.

The nightly build of Conreality Player is available [at this link](https://conreality.app/player.apk "Conreality Player App nightly build"). We have a WhatsApp Public Testing group as well, if you're interested in joining ask us on Twitter [here][3].
